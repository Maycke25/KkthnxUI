Put these files  in `...C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft` Or where ever you have your World of Warcraft installed. You get the idea.   

### Donations   
* Donations are welcome, but not required to use the UI at all. Donations help me further my development and fuel my gaming! Donations will never be a requirement! If you would like to donate, you can do so here [Donate to KkthnxUI](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=XC5463FDLTKSE&lc=US&item_name=KkthnxUI&item_number=55846984&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)

* To move the **pet bar / stance bar** you have to **shift+alt+click** the first button on the bar and hold and drag where you would like it!
